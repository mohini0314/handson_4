    <p class="intro">What is CSS?</p>
    <ol class="order" type="1">
    <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
    <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li><br>
    <li><oneline>Css is not neccesary </oneline><new>CSS saves a lot of work.</new> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li><br>
    <li style="text-decoration:underline;">External stylsheets are stored in CSS files.</li><br>
    </ol>

    <p class="intro">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</p>
    <ul class="unorder">
    <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
    <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
    <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
    <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in externaCSS files. However, <new>in this <br>
    tutorial we will use inline and inetrnal styles,</new> because this is easier to demonstrate. and easier <br>
    for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="para">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also <br>
    special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript. </p>

    <p class="para">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has targeted, a style oe set of style can be applied to the <br>
    element.</p>

    <p class="para">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target element to which a style should be applied.</p>
